<p><tab>Tourism in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">DEHRADUN </span>is growing rapidly. Dehradun is made up of two words: 'Dehra' is derived from the word "dera", meaning camp or temporary settlement. "Dun" or "Doon" is a term for the valley that lies between the Himalayas and the "Shivaliks". When Guru Ram Rai, son of Guru Har Rai, came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of Shiva. In ancient India during the Mahabharata epic era, Dronacharya the great teacher of Kauravas and Pandavas, lived here hence the name, "Dronanagari" (lit. city of Drona).Some historians believe that the word Dehra can be regarded as a term for campingFor centuries, dehradun has been a popular place of attraction for foreign travelers. .</i></p>
