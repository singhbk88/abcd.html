  <h2><p id="Tourism"></p>Tourism</h2>
  <p>The government initiatives in development of tourism date back to 1937 when the Ceylon Tourist Bureau was established.[2] However, it was closed down in September 1939 due to World War II. After Sri Lanka's independence the promotion of tourism was again considered by re-establishing the Ceylon Tourist Board which took over the function of the Tourist Bureau. More formal recognition for the country's tourism sector was given with the enactment of Act No. 10 of 1966.[3] This provided the legislation for the establishment of Ceylon Tourist Board. Since then the Ceylon Tourist Board has functioned as the state agency, responsible for development and promotion of the tourism sector in Sri Lanka.  <a href="#top"><i>Top</i></a></p>

The tourist traffic in 1982 showed that there was a remarkable growth in number of tourists, with 407,230 arrivals.[6] However, with the beginning of the civil war in 1983, the growth of tourist arrivals declined and stagnated to around 300,000 - 500,000 arrivals annually.<a href="#top"><i>Top</i></a></p>
